<h1>Case Study</h1>
<br>
This is the second project of 2024, a poetry website that utilizes Open Props, custom variables used by designers and developers in their CSS to customize their sites. Some find it easier to use than regular CSS, but it was challenging for this project! I initially attempted to write the poem in the sky of the background image, but couldn't figure it out. Instead, I used my image as the background, starting from the sky and descending into the woods to capture the full scope. I chose a script font to symbolize the forms that stars make and give it an enchanting feeling. The color represents the stars' glow while ensuring legibility. Despite the challenges of using Open Props, the website turned out well! Click the github icon to see my github!
