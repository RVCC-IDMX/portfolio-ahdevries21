<h1>Case Study</h1>
<br>
This project was the first site created in 2024. This webpage was created to explore 11ty, Sass,  and BEM CSS - all modern approaches to web design. I chose an old poem called The Hymn of the Sea, an old English poem from William Cullen Bryant, as the main content for this site. Wanting to keep the old English writing style and aesthetic, I choose a parchment background as well as a script font, representing the author writing his poem on old parchment. Silas Baisch took the images selected below the title from Upsplash. The image complements the website very well, as it draws attention but still matches the theme and does not feel out of place with the rest of the website.
