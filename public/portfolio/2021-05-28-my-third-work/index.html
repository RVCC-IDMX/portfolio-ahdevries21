<h1>Case Study</h1>
<br>
In this project, I aimed to explore color theory in UI Design. Color is crucial for aesthetics, providing direction, evoking emotions, and aiding in conveying meaning. I created a product card to practice color theory and enhance the overall design. I chose a bakery theme and featured a baguette as the main product. To complement the emoji, I selected a color palette reminiscent of a bakery. After experimenting with different designs, I settled on a color layout. I used a lighter beige to ensure the visibility of the baguette and a light gray for the bakery, making it readable without overshadowing the main product title, "Fresh Baguette." The text, in a similar gray shade, still attracts attention but not to the same extent as the title. The heart icon on the right shares the same color palette as the baguette. When tapped, it changes into those colors, serving as a reminder to the user that they've selected it. The two buttons at the bottom contrast each other, with the "buy now" button using a dark brown and the same background color for the text, creating an eye-catching effect. The "add to cart" button is less subtle, but the text makes the button stand out. This versatile product card can also be used for other bread and bakery-related items, serving various purposes.
